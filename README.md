Divvy-Van-Navigator

# This is a group project made by the efforts of Me, Mike Gibson, and Paul Chirmal. The idea of this project is to help 
# the Divvy Bike Organization in optimizing the transport and pickup of Divvy vehicles between Divvy stations/docks done by
# Divvy Van Drivers. Divvy Bike is a bike share program in the city of Chicago where people can take a bike from a Divvy 
# station and us it to travel faster in the city. The bike taken can be put in any other station in the city but this can
# lead to overflow or lack of bicks at specific stations. Divvy Van Drivers are tasked to pick up bikes from stations with
# overflow and drop off bikes at places with a lack of bikes.
